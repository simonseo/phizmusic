# PhizMusic — Physics-First Music Theory Wiki

Music theory rebuilt from physics, for minds that think in equations.

PhizMusic is a foundational music theory framework that derives every concept from physics, mathematics, and neuroscience. Where conventional Western music theory relies on 18th-century terminology and notation conventions that obscure the underlying physics, PhizMusic uses physics-literal vocabulary, transparent mathematical relationships, and psychoacoustic evidence to explain how music works and why it sounds the way it does.

Every culture's music system is a different engineering solution to the same mathematical constraints. PhizMusic provides the shared physics vocabulary to understand them all.

## Target Audience

This wiki is designed for the scientifically-minded learner — someone with a solid understanding of physics, math, and biology who appreciates multicultural music but finds conventional Western music theory incomprehensible. If you've ever wondered why a "fifth" is called a "fifth" when it's actually a 3:2 frequency ratio, this framework is for you.

## Design Principles

- **Physics-literal vocabulary** — every term means what it says. A step-interval of 7 is always 7 chromatic steps. A frequency ratio of 3:2 is always 3:2.
- **Psychoacoustics woven throughout** — perceptual neuroscience isn't a separate chapter; it's integrated into every concept, explaining WHY things sound the way they do.
- **Dual-level writing** — rigorous college-level explanations with `> 🎯 **Simple version**` blocks for quick intuitive understanding.
- **Translation tables** — every relevant page maps PhizMusic terms to Western and other cultural equivalents. 100% internal elegance; translation tables handle external communication.
- **Cultural respect** — different tuning systems and musical traditions are "different engineering solutions to the same mathematical constraints," never "inferior approximations."
- **Atomic concept pages** — one concept per page, interconnected by links. Enter anywhere, follow your curiosity.

## Mathematical Notation

Formulas are written in inline code blocks for portability:

- Frequency formula: `f = 440 × 2^((n - 69) / 12)` where n = MIDI note number
- Cent formula: `c = 1200 × log₂(f₂/f₁)`
- Harmonic series: `fₙ = n × f₁` for integer n

Future versions may render these using KaTeX for proper mathematical typesetting.

## The Dodeka Syllable System

The syllable system used throughout this wiki — **Do, Ka, Re, Xo, Mi, Fa, Hu, So, Bi, La, Ve, Si** — is adapted from the [Dodeka Music](https://dodekamusic.com/) system by Jacques-Daniel Rochat. Each of the 12 chromatic steps gets one unique syllable, with no sharps or flats needed. See [Naming System](naming-system.md) for full details.
