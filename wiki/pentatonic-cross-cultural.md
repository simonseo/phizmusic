# Pentatonic & Cross-Cultural Scales

The pentatonic scale — step-subset **{0, 2, 4, 7, 9}** — appears independently in Chinese, Japanese, Scottish, West African, Andean, Native American, and many other musical traditions. This is not cultural diffusion. It is convergent engineering: when humans worldwide select 5 pitches from 12, they overwhelmingly converge on subsets that maximize consonant relationships and avoid roughness.

> 🎯 **Simple version**: The 5-note pentatonic scale appears in almost every culture on Earth. It's not because they copied each other — it's because this particular set of 5 notes avoids all the "clashing" intervals and includes the most "cooperative" ones. It's the safest, most universally pleasant menu you can pick from 12 options.

## Why {0, 2, 4, 7, 9}?

This step-subset has two remarkable properties:

### Property 1: Maximum Consonant Relationships

Every note in {0, 2, 4, 7, 9} has at least one partner at the 5-step-interval or 7 — the two most consonant intervals after the octave:

| Note | Step-5 partner | Step-7 partner |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| 0 | 7 ✓ (step-7) | 7 ✓ (step-7) |
| 2 | 7 ✓ (step-5) | 9 ✓ (step-7) |
| 4 | 9 ✓ (step-5) | — |
| 7 | 0 ✓ (step-5) | 2 ✓ (step-5) |
| 9 | 2 ✓ (step-5) | 4 ✓ (step-5) |

The network of step-7 (3:2) and step-5 (4:3) relationships is dense — there is no "isolated" note lacking strong consonant connections.

### Property 2: Complete Avoidance of Roughness Intervals

The step-intervals present *between any two members* of {0, 2, 4, 7, 9} are:

```
Available: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10
Missing:   1, 6, 11
```

Step-intervals 1 and 11 are the intervals of maximum roughness — two frequencies so close that they create strong beating within critical bandwidth. The 6-step-interval (the tritone) is the point of maximum harmonic ambiguity. By excluding all three, the pentatonic subset eliminates every interval that produces strong perceptual tension.

This is why pentatonic melodies sound "safe" — they can't clash. Any note can follow any other note without producing roughness. This makes the pentatonic scale ideal for:
- Group singing (everyone sounds good together)
- Improvisation (no "wrong" notes)
- Cross-cultural accessibility (minimal cognitive load)

## The Chinese Derivation: 3:2 Stacking

Chinese music theory derives the pentatonic from **sanfen sunyi** (三分损益) — the method of "subtract and add one-third":

Starting from any frequency:
1. Multiply by 3/2 (go up a 7-step-interval): → step 7
2. Multiply by 3/2 again: → step 14 = step 2 (mod 12)
3. Again: → step 9
4. Again: → step 4

Sort the result: **{0, 2, 4, 7, 9}**

This is pure 3-limit tuning — only the prime factor 3 is used (ratios involve only powers of 2 and 3). The Chinese names (宫 gōng, 商 shāng, 角 jué, 徵 zhǐ, 羽 yǔ) predate any Western scale theory by centuries.

The identical mathematical process appears in Pythagorean tuning — stack 7-step-intervals (3:2 ratio) and collect the notes. Same physics, different continent, different millennium, same result.

## Cross-Cultural Appearances

| Culture | Scale name | Step-subset | Derivation method |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Chinese | 宫调 (gōng diào) | {0, 2, 4, 7, 9} | 3:2 stacking (sanfen sunyi) |
| Japanese | Yo scale | {0, 2, 4, 7, 9} | — |
| Scottish/Celtic | (unnamed, in folk) | {0, 2, 4, 7, 9} and rotations | Oral tradition |
| West African | (varies by region) | {0, 2, 4, 7, 9} and rotations | Oral tradition |
| Andean | (in siku/panpipe music) | {0, 2, 4, 7, 9} | Instrument construction |
| Blues | Blues pentatonic (minor) | {0, 3, 5, 7, 10} (rotation) | Oral tradition, African roots |

The **minor pentatonic** {0, 3, 5, 7, 10} is a rotation (mode) of the same set — start the major pentatonic from step 9 instead of step 0. The interval content is identical; only the starting point differs. See [scales.md](scales.md) for mode rotation.

## Blue Notes: Harmonic Series Pitch Inflections

Blues and jazz musicians routinely bend pitches away from 12-TET grid positions toward frequencies derived from the harmonic series. Two "blue notes" are particularly prominent:

**The blue third** (~310-330 cents): falls between the 3-step-interval (300 cents) and the 4-step-interval (400 cents). This pitch region corresponds to neither the 6:5 ratio (316 cents, the ~3.2 step-interval) nor the 5:4 ratio (386 cents, the ~3.9 step-interval) — it inhabits a perceptual "between" space that is characteristic of blues expression. Some analyses relate it to the 7:6 ratio (267 cents) or the 19th harmonic.

**The blue seventh** (~969 cents): close to the 7th harmonic (ratio 7:4 = 968.8 cents), which falls 31 cents below 12-TET step-10 (1000 cents). Blues and gospel singers naturally gravitate toward this pitch — it's a harmonic-series target that 12-TET can't reach. Barbershop quartets tune their "barbershop seventh" chords to this natural ratio.

Blue notes demonstrate that **pitch is continuous**, not limited to 12 discrete steps. Performers bend, slide, and inflect toward natural ratios that the 12-TET grid only approximates. The PhizMusic framework — with its continuous log-frequency overlay on the chromatic grid (see [notation-layer.md](notation-layer.md)) — is designed to represent exactly this kind of micro-intonation.

## Just vs. Tempered Pentatonic

How close is the 12-TET pentatonic to the just (3:2-stacked) version?

| Step | Just ratio | Just cents | 12-TET cents | Error |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| 0 | 1:1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 2 | 9:8 | 203.9 | 200 | -3.9 |
| 4 | 81:64 | 407.8 | 400 | -7.8 |
| 7 | 3:2 | 702.0 | 700 | -2.0 |
| 9 | 27:16 | 905.9 | 900 | -5.9 |

Maximum error: 7.8 cents (on step 4). This is barely perceptible even to trained musicians. The pentatonic is the step-subset least damaged by the 12-TET compromise — another reason for its cross-cultural robustness.

Note: step 4 in the 3-limit pentatonic has ratio 81:64 (a Pythagorean 4-step-interval, ~408 cents), not 5:4 (a just 4-step-interval, ~386 cents). The Chinese pentatonic is 3-limit — it uses no factor of 5. The 5-limit 4-step-interval (386 cents) is a different interval entirely. This distinction between 3-limit and 5-limit tuning is a key insight of the [prime-limit framework](frequency-ratios.md).

## Other Cultures, Other Subsets

The pentatonic is the most universal subset, but it's not the only one. Different cultures optimize for different priorities:

| Tradition | Approach | Prime limit | Optimization target |
|-----------|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Chinese classical | 5-of-12, stacked 3:2 | 3-limit | Maximal fifth/fourth consonance |
| Indian raga | 5-7+ of flexible grid | 5-limit | Specific melodic motion rules (raga grammar) |
| Arabic maqam | 7+ of ~24 divisions | 11-limit | "Neutral" intervals (~350 cents, ~150 cents) |
| Javanese gamelan (slendro) | 5-of-~5 | Non-ratio | Timbre-matched to inharmonic metallophones |
| Javanese gamelan (pelog) | 7-of-~7 | Non-ratio | Timbre-matched, deliberate beating (ombak) |

Each represents a **different engineering solution to the same mathematical constraints** — the irrationality of log₂(3), the critical bandwidth of the cochlea, and the harmonic or inharmonic spectra of the culture's instruments. No hierarchy. No "progression." Just different trade-offs.

Detailed treatment of Indian raga, Arabic maqam, and Javanese gamelan is deferred to Tier 3 — see [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md).
