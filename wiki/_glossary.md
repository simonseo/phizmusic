# PhizMusic Glossary

The canonical vocabulary reference for the PhizMusic framework. Every novel term used in this wiki is defined here. Definitions are grounded in physics and neuroscience. Western equivalents are noted in parentheses where applicable.

---

**12-TET** — Twelve-tone equal temperament. Divides the octave into 12 equal chromatic steps of 100 cents each (frequency ratio 2^(1/12) ≈ 1.05946 per step). The dominant tuning system in modern Western music. See [twelve-tet.md](twelve-tet.md).

**ADSR** — Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release. The four phases of a sound's amplitude envelope over time. Attack is onset to peak; decay is peak to sustain level; sustain is the held level; release is sustain to silence. See [adsr-envelope.md](adsr-envelope.md).

**Amplitude** — Peak displacement of a pressure wave from equilibrium. Measured in pascals (Pa) or decibels (dB SPL). Determines perceived loudness — though the relationship is frequency-dependent (see [equal-loudness.md](equal-loudness.md)).

**Auditory masking** — The phenomenon where one sound renders another inaudible. Includes simultaneous masking (frequency domain) and temporal masking (time domain). Exploited by lossy audio compression (MP3, AAC). See [auditory-masking.md](auditory-masking.md).

**Cent** — Logarithmic unit for measuring frequency ratios. 1 octave = 1200 cents. 1 chromatic step in 12-TET = 100 cents. Formula: `c = 1200 × log₂(f₂/f₁)`. Essential for comparing intervals across tuning systems.

**Chromatic step** — One of the 12 equal divisions of an octave in 12-TET. The smallest standard interval, with frequency ratio 2^(1/12) ≈ 1.05946. (Western equivalent: "half step" or "semitone.")

**Combination tone** — A phantom tone generated by nonlinear cochlear processes when two tones sound simultaneously. The most audible is the difference tone at frequency f₂ − f₁ (also called a Tartini tone). See [consonance-dissonance.md](consonance-dissonance.md).

**Consonance** — The perceptual quality of tones that fuse or blend. Arises from aligned harmonics, absence of roughness within critical bandwidth, and harmonic template matching. Whether consonance is aesthetically *preferred* is cultural, but the perceptual fusion itself is biological. See [consonance-dissonance.md](consonance-dissonance.md).

**Critical bandwidth** — The frequency range within which two simultaneous tones interact perceptually, producing roughness or beating. Approximately 10-20% of center frequency, determined by the physical properties of the basilar membrane. See [ear-cochlea.md](ear-cochlea.md).

**Cycle** — A repeating temporal pattern of defined length, measured in multiples of pulse period T. A cycle of 4T contains 4 pulse beats. (Western equivalent: "measure" or "bar.") See [rhythm.md](rhythm.md).

**Dissonance** — The perceptual quality of tones that clash or create tension. Caused by beating of nearby harmonics within critical bandwidth (roughness) or failure to match harmonic series templates. See [consonance-dissonance.md](consonance-dissonance.md).

**Duration** — How long a sound event lasts, expressed as a fraction or multiple of pulse period T. A sound lasting one pulse = 1T; half a pulse = 0.5T. (Western equivalent: "note value" — e.g., quarter note = 1T at standard tempo.) See [rhythm.md](rhythm.md).

**Fourier analysis** — The mathematical decomposition of any complex waveform into a sum of sine waves at different frequencies and amplitudes. The cochlea physically performs this decomposition via basilar membrane resonance. See [fourier-analysis.md](fourier-analysis.md).

**Frequency** — The number of complete oscillations per second, measured in hertz (Hz). Determines perceived pitch. Human hearing range: approximately 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. See [sound-waves.md](sound-waves.md).

**Frequency ratio** — The ratio of two frequencies, f₂/f₁. Determines the perceived interval between them. Simple integer ratios (2:1, 3:2, 5:4) correspond to perceptually consonant intervals. See [frequency-ratios.md](frequency-ratios.md).

**Fundamental** — The lowest frequency component of a complex tone. Determines the perceived pitch. All other frequency components (harmonics) are integer multiples of the fundamental. See [harmonic-series.md](harmonic-series.md).

**Harmonic** — A frequency component that is an integer multiple of the fundamental. The 2nd harmonic = 2×f₁, the 3rd = 3×f₁, etc. Instruments with harmonic spectra (strings, pipes) support harmonic-series-based tuning systems. See [harmonic-series.md](harmonic-series.md).

**Harmonic series** — The sequence of all integer multiples of a fundamental frequency: f₁, 2f₁, 3f₁, 4f₁, ... . Naturally produced by vibrating strings and air columns. The foundation of tonal music across cultures. See [harmonic-series.md](harmonic-series.md).

**Inharmonic** — Describing a spectrum whose overtone frequencies are NOT integer multiples of the fundamental. Bells, drums, and metallophones produce inharmonic spectra. Inharmonic instruments favor different tuning systems than harmonic ones (Sethares' timbre-tuning coupling). See [instrument-physics.md](instrument-physics.md).

**Missing fundamental** — The perception of a pitch not physically present in a sound, inferred by the auditory system from the harmonic pattern of the upper partials. Demonstrates that pitch is a neural construct, not a direct physical measurement. See [missing-fundamental.md](missing-fundamental.md).

**Octave** — The interval between two frequencies in a 2:1 ratio. Pitches separated by an octave are perceived as the same "chroma" (pitch class) at different heights. The octave is the most universal musical interval across cultures. See [frequency-ratios.md](frequency-ratios.md).

**Onset** — The moment a sound event begins, measured as a time position within a cycle. Expressed as a fraction of the cycle length. (Western equivalent: beat position within a measure.) See [rhythm.md](rhythm.md).

**Overtone** — Any frequency component above the fundamental. May be harmonic (integer multiple of fundamental) or inharmonic (non-integer multiple). "Overtone" is a general term; "harmonic" specifically means integer-multiple overtones.

**Phon** — Unit of perceived loudness that accounts for frequency-dependent hearing sensitivity. Defined relative to a 1 kHz reference: N phon = the loudness of a 1 kHz tone at N dB SPL. A 100 Hz tone needs more dB SPL to achieve the same phon level. See [equal-loudness.md](equal-loudness.md).

**Prime limit** — The largest prime factor appearing in the frequency ratios of a tuning system. 3-limit (Pythagorean) uses only ratios with factors of 2 and 3. 5-limit adds factor 5 (major/minor thirds). 7-limit and 11-limit incorporate progressively more complex ratios. Unifies world tuning systems: 3-limit (Chinese), 5-limit (Indian/Western), 11-limit (Arabic). See [scales.md](scales.md).

**Pulse** — A regular temporal reference beat. Measured by period T (seconds between pulses) or rate (BPM = 60/T). The pulse is the temporal anchor for all rhythm. (Western equivalent: "beat.") See [rhythm.md](rhythm.md).

**Ratio-set** — A chord described by the frequency ratios of its components. Example: 4:5:6 describes the ratio relationship of a chord whose components are in the 4th, 5th, and 6th harmonic positions. Ratio-sets explain *why* a chord sounds the way it does (physics). See [chords.md](chords.md).

**Roughness** — The perceptual quality caused by two frequencies within critical bandwidth beating against each other. Creates a "buzzy" or "grating" sensation. Maximum roughness occurs when two tones are separated by approximately 1/4 of the critical bandwidth. See [consonance-dissonance.md](consonance-dissonance.md).

**Spectrum** — The distribution of energy across frequencies in a sound. A pure sine wave has a single-frequency spectrum. A complex tone has energy at multiple frequencies (harmonics). The spectrum determines timbre. See [fourier-analysis.md](fourier-analysis.md).

**Step-distance** — The number of chromatic steps between two pitches, ranging from 0 to 11 within one octave. This is the PhizMusic measure of interval size. Step-distance 7 = 3:2 frequency ratio ≈ "perfect fifth" in Western terms. See [intervals.md](intervals.md).

**Step-number** — A pitch identified by its chromatic position (0-11) plus octave number. Formal PhizMusic pitch notation. Example: 7.4 = step 7 in octave 4 = So4 = G4. Step-numbers make transposition trivial: transpose up by 3 = add 3 (mod 12). See [naming-system.md](naming-system.md).

**Step-set** — A chord described by the chromatic step positions of its components relative to the lowest note. Example: {0,4,7} describes a chord with root, a note 4 steps above, and a note 7 steps above. Step-sets specify *which* notes to play (practical). See [chords.md](chords.md).

**Step-subset** — A scale defined as a selection of step-numbers from {0, 1, 2, ..., 11}. Example: pentatonic major = {0, 2, 4, 7, 9} — five notes selected from the 12 available. Different step-subsets produce different scale "flavors." See [scales.md](scales.md).

**Syllable** — The Dodeka-derived short name for each chromatic step: Do (0), Ka (1), Re (2), Xo (3), Mi (4), Fa (5), Hu (6), So (7), Bi (8), La (9), Ve (10), Si (11). Casual PhizMusic pitch notation, designed for speaking and singing. See [naming-system.md](naming-system.md).

**Timbre** — The perceptual quality of a sound determined by its spectrum — which harmonics are present and at what amplitudes. Same pitch + different spectrum = different timbre. Timbre is why a piano and violin playing the same note sound different. See [timbre.md](timbre.md).

**Voice-leading** — The movement between successive chords, measured by the total step-distance traveled by individual notes. Smooth voice-leading minimizes total movement. (Western equivalent: "voice leading" or "part writing.") See [chord-progressions.md](chord-progressions.md).

**Waveform** — The shape of a pressure wave plotted over time (oscillogram). Related to spectrum by Fourier transform: waveform and spectrum contain the same information in different representations. See [sound-waves.md](sound-waves.md).

## Note on Terminology

The syllable system (**Do, Ka, Re, Xo, Mi, Fa, Hu, So, Bi, La, Ve, Si**) is adapted from the [Dodeka Music](https://dodekamusic.com/) system by Jacques-Daniel Rochat. The 12th syllable is "Si" (not "Ti"). See [Naming System](naming-system.md) for the full naming convention.
